AL,Alabama,,,
AR,Arkansas,"A temporary halting of trials beginning March 16, 2020 through June 2020 caused a decrease in new offense violations in 2020. Delays in data entry can result in people incarcerated for a parole violation to be counted as having a technical violation in queries. Recent improvements in data validation and query logic led to increased accuracy in the identification of people with technical violations of probation, which is the primary reason for the increase reported.",,
AZ,Arizona,,,
CA,California,"As a result of the Public Safety Realignment Act of 2011, people who violate the terms of parole supervision without a new felony conviction must serve any incarceration time ordered in a county jail rather than prison.",,

Technical parole violations may include individuals ultimately receiving a new felony conviction. ",,
DE,Delaware,"Delaware has a unified system, meaning the state has jurisdiction over people incarcerated in both jail and prison.

The state discontinued use of parole on cases after 1991, but a small number of people are still under supervision of the Parole Board. For the purposes of this report, parole populations were not included. ",,

Technical probation and parole violations may include individuals ultimately receiving a new felony conviction.",,
IL,Illinois,"Probation terms are not identified in prison data, as probation is run by the Illinois Administrative Office of the Courts.

Technical parole violations may include individuals ultimately receiving a new felony conviction.",,
IN,Indiana,,,
KS,Kansas,"Probation supervision in Kansas is provided by two different agencies: Court Services and Community Corrections.

Technical probation and parole violations may include individuals ultimately receiving a new felony conviction.",,
KY,Kentucky,"Kentucky does not currently have the capacity to separate out technical violations of probation.

MI,Michigan,"There are three probation supervision delivery systems in Minnesota (largely county-operated) and mechanisms have not been created for the various systems to report reasons for revocation.

All prison sentences include a period of supervision—two-thirds of the sentence is served as incarceration, and one-third of the sentence is served on supervision—and the Minnesota Department of Corrections has the authority to make adjustments to incarceration and supervision time depending on a person’s behavior while incarcerated.

MT,Montana,"Montana has a third commitment status of “DOC Commits” which allows the Montana Department of Corrections (DOC) to determine by placement in an Assessment Center where an individual is assessed and placed in either the community under supervision/Alt-Secure Facilities or directly to prison. Revocations to prison can come from Alt-Secure Facilities (Treatment Centers, PreRelease Centers, or Assessment & Sanction Centers) or from Probation, Parole, or Conditional Release.
