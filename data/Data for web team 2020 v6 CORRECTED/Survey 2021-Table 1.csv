Oregon is a combined state in that we supervise probation and parole together; so if a client is revoked its hard to determine which case drove the actual revocation; so this data just looks at the highest supervision status of the body at the time of revocation and puts them in that revocation bucket. For example, if a person has both a probation case and several parole sentences running, their status in our system shows as parole as the highest case supervision status but if the probation case was actually the driver for the revocation, this person shows in the parole revocation group for the length of stay data.",
