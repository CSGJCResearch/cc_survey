Due to existing limitations in RIDOC's existing database, tracking specific violation types for probation and parole absconders is often difficult in our commitment files. This is why on the JRI Tracking Spreadsheet a handful of cases are coded as 'unknown' every month. Updated CY20 sentenced commitment has been provided to include the entire calendar year. I personally spot checked each missing case in our data system to give a more accurate breakdown of violation type as it pertains to probation and parole absconders.",,,
